Never get lost looking for a bathroom or a drinking fountain again! TakeABreak lets you quickly find nearby public restrooms and drinking water fountains close to you. The app is good for hikers, bikers and urban dwellers alike! You can also choose to find nearby restaurants, but you may have to be a consumer of a store or restaurant in order to use the amenities.
The app queries the massive openstreetmap.org database for data, so anyone can add and make edits to the database. OpenStreetMap (OSM) is an open project to create a freely available map, a bit like the Wikipedia of maps. However, the database is not yet complete, and the usefulness of this app depends a lot on the completeness of the OSM database around you. Generally, OSM has more data in European cities than elsewhere. If you know some locations that's missing on the map, you're more than welcome to add them to the global OpenStreetMap database.
